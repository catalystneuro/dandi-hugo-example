        The DANDI platform is supported by the <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRAIN Initiative</a> for publishing, sharing, and processing neurophysiology data. The archive accepts cellular neurophysiology data including electrophysiology, optophysiology, and behavioral time-series, and images from immunostaining experiments. The platform is now available for data upload and distribution. The storage of data in the archive is also supported by the <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Opendata program</a>.

# Why DANDI?

As an exercise, let's assume you lose all the data in your lab. What would you want from the archive? Our hope is that your answer to this question, the necessary data and metadata that you need, is at least what we should be storing.

DANDI provides:

1. A cloud-based platform to store, process, and disseminate data. You can use DANDI to collaborate and publish datasets.
2. Open access to data to enable secondary uses of data outside the intent of the study.
3. Optimize data storage and access through partnerships, compression and accessibility technologies.
4. Enables reproducible practices and publications through data standards such as NWB and BIDS, which provide extensive metadata.
5. The platform is not just an endpoint to dump data, it is intended as a living repository that enables collaboration within and across labs, and for others, the entry point for research.

For a better view of how DANDI might help you, please see these [onboarding slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hqw0vgNmelNnkPLuCSA1L5Rlu2rXeZEF6bsgc0y6Ve4/edit#slide=id.g113edc9c042_0_67).
